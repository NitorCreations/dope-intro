# Slide notes #

 * Slide notes are markdown files named ```{slidename}.md.notes```
 * They appear in the http interface for running the presentation
    * Need to have ```{slidename}.md``` for the notes to be added next to the slide
 * Slides are served as iframes, but notes are just embedded in the index html
